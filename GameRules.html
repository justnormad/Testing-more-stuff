            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                  <strong><li>Decks:</li></strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>There are 2 sides of cards: Plant side and Zombie side. You must have both a Plant deck and a Zombie deck to play.</li>
                    <li>Your deck must consist of exactly 30 cards with a maximum of 3 copies of each card.</li>
                    <li>You can only have 1 copy of each legendary card in your deck, and you can only have 3 legendary cards in your deck total.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong><li>Card Types:</li></strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>There are 3 main types of cards: Fighters, Tricks, and Heroes.</li>
                    <li>Fighters are Plants and Zombies characters that stay on the lawn. They have Strength and Health. They can also have Traits or Abilities. They can attack and block attacks.</li>
                    <li>Tricks are Abilities that you can play. They are then sent to the discard pile after the Abilities are used.</li>
                    <li>Heroes are the representatives of a class. It does not count towards the deck size, you can choose not to use Heroes in your deck. Heroes have specific requirements to be played in a deck. Their Abilities work like Fighter's, but Heroes cannot be removed from the lawn in any way.</li>
                    <li>Moreover, there are Tokens, which are any cards that are created by other cards' Abilities. They cannot be used in a Deck.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, there are Superpowers. They are Tricks in the Superpowers zones rather than the deck. You can only have 2 Superpowers in the zones. If you use a Hero, you can use that Hero's signature Superpower as the second card.</li>
                    <li>All cards have a class. Some cards can have multiple classes.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong><li>The Lawn:</li></strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The lawn consists of a 2 deck zones, a discard pile, a graveyard, 2 Heroes zones, 2 Superpowers zones, and 5 lanes, with 1 Plant Dummy and 1 Zombie Dummy on each lane.</li>
                    <li>Each player gets their own lawn. That means there are a total of 10 lanes in play.</li>
                    <li>You play Fighters onto a lane. Plants go on your lawn, Zombies go on your opponent's lawn. A lane can only hold up to 1 plant and 1 zombie unless a Trait or an Ability allows you.</li>
                    <li>You reveal Tricks from your hand to play them. Then they go to the discard pile.</li>
                    <li>Heroes zones are for your Heroes, and Superpowers zones are for your Superpowers.</li>
                    <li>The dummies determine how you win, read more at <a href = "#CombatAndWinning">6. Combat & Winning.</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong><li>Resources:</li></strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Cards have costs. You have to pay the cost using your resources in order to play them.</li>
                    <li>The 2 resources are Sun and Brains. Plant cards cost Sun to play, while Zombie cards cost Brains to play.</li>
                    <li>Both players get 1 Sun and 1 Brain on their Start Phase on their first turns. Then 2 Sun and Brains on their second turns. This number keeps increasing until reaching 10. The maximum of sun and brain you can hold is 16 each.</li>
                    <li>Sun and Brains carry between turns. There are also Abilities that can give Sun or Brains.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong><li>Starting the game & Turn Details:</li></strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Both players start the game by putting their Decks on the Deck zone, then each player roll a die to determine who goes first. Next, both players draw 3 cards from their Plant deck which they can any number of cards to place on the bottom of the deck to draw that many cards. Do the same for the Zombie cards. Lastly, the both players get 1 Sun and Brain.</li>
                    <li>Each player can only hold up to 10 cards in their hands. If a player has more than 10 cards in their hand on their End Phase, they discard cards until they have 10 cards.</li>
                    <li>There are 4 phases in each turn: Start Phase, Main Phase, Combat Phase, and End Phase.</li>
                    <li>Start Phase: Both players draw a card from both decks and receive their resources. Some Abilities trigger here.</li>
                    <li>Main Phase: Main Phases are divided into 3 sub-phases. Those are Player 1 Zombie Play, Player 2 Both Play, and Player 1 Plant Play. Players can play their Fighters, and Tricks according to the subphase.</li>
                    <li>Combat Phase: Combat happens here. Read more at <a href="#CombatAndWinning">6. Combat & Winning.</a></li>
                    <li>- End Phase: Some Abilities trigger here. Some Abilities end here.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div id="CombatAndWinning"></div>
                  <strong><li>Combat & Winning:</li></strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>During the Combat Phase. Plants and Zombies fight each other, lane by lane.</li>
                    <li>Combat always start from the Heights lane to the Aquatics lane.</li>
                    <li>When Plants and Zombies fight, deduct the frontmost Plant's Health from the Zombies' combined Strengths, then deduct the frontmost Zombie's Health fron the Plants' combined Strengths.</li>
                    <li>All Plants and Zombies in a lane attack simutenously. "When hurt" and "When this hurt/destroy" effects happen after the damage calculation.</li>
                    <li>If a Fighter's Health reaches 0, it is destroyed.</li>
                    <li>If there are only Plants or Zombies on that lane, they can hit the other side's Dummy.</li>
                    <li>Dummies work differently for both sides. Zombie Dummies have 8 Health. The Health works like the Fighters' Health. Meanwhile, Plant Dummies have 3 Shields, and any attack can deduct 1 Shield.</li>
                    <li>When a Dummy is destroyed, destroy all opponent's Fighters on that lane. Then the player whose Dummy was destroyed draws 1 Superpower card from the destroyed Dummy's side.</li>
                    <li>If you destroy 3 of your opponent's Plant or Zombie Dummies, you win the game.</li>
                  </ul>
